# The retranslation (jobs 10193-10195) fixed the translation-truncation
# artefact for real this time: 0 truncated fields across train/dev/test
# (was 109, then 14, now 0 -- see scripts/translate_to_basque.py's history
# for the environment bug, tabular-text bug, and token-budget-gate bug this
# took to actually close). The retrieval indices are built from train, which
# is fully clean.
#
# The gate below is scoped to train+dev only, deliberately excluding test:
# casimedicos_eu/test.jsonl legitimately has 8 more records than
# casimedicos/test.jsonl (their Spanish originals no longer exist anywhere
# in the current corpus, confirmed by searching casimedicos/all.jsonl too --
# not translator hallucination, just orphaned from an earlier ES test-split
# regeneration). Per explicit instruction the fuller 125-record Basque test
# set is kept rather than cut down to match the smaller 117-record Spanish
# one, so the id-set-mismatch check on test is expected to keep "failing"
# and must not block the index rebuild.
#
# Index building embeds the whole corpus and is genuinely GPU-bound, unlike the tiny
# Marian translator. This job requests TWO GPUs (gres=gpu:2) and builds the two
# single-domain indices in parallel, one per card, then the combined index. Latency
# is not being measured here, so parallelism is free.
