"""MeanQ: the quality score used to choose the best RAG configuration.

MeanQ = mean(ROUGE-L, BERT-F1, MC-accuracy), each as its raw 0-100 value, averaged
over the three seeds, on the no-self-feedback (initial) prediction.

Rationale for the choice of metrics: ROUGE-L captures lexical fidelity, BERT-F1
captures semantic fidelity, and MC-accuracy captures decision correctness. Averaging
the three rewards a configuration only if it does well on all of the axes the thesis
cares about, rather than winning on one and losing on the others -- which a single
metric (e.g. BERTScore alone) can hide.

MC-accuracy is defined only for CasiMedicos-Exp (multiple-choice) records. On the
mixed dev set it is therefore read from the CasiMedicos subset (`_casimedicos.json`),
matching how the results tables report it. On an open-answer-only set (SNS-1064)
MC-accuracy does not exist and MeanQ is the mean of the two overlap metrics.

This module is pure computation over the metric JSONs; it loads no models and needs
no GPU. It is the single source of truth for "which RAG config is best" and is used
both to report the decision and to wire the dependent configs (few-shot, domain
restriction) to the correct base.

    Reduces to the plain highest-mean-MeanQ winner whenever the leader's mean
    is at least `margin` points clear of every other candidate. Otherwise, the
    leader is compared pairwise against each candidate within `margin` points:
    standard deviation awards one point to whichever side has a std at least
    `std_threshold` MeanQ points lower (an ABSOLUTE difference, not a fraction
    of the larger std -- a relative/percentage threshold makes it trivially
    easy to "meaningfully" beat a candidate whose own std is already small,
    since a tiny absolute gap can still clear a large percentage of a tiny
    denominator; std_threshold matches `margin`'s own scale, since both ask
    "is this difference at least as large as the smallest gap this thesis
    already treats as a real MeanQ difference"). Cost awards its own point the
    same way as before, as a fraction of the larger cost (`cost_ratio`) -- cost
    is a designed quantity with no sampling noise of its own, so a relative
    threshold does not have the same failure mode there. A criterion that
    doesn't clear its own threshold awards no point to either side. Whichever
    side has more points after both criteria is preferred; if the two split
    one point each, or neither criterion is decisive, the pairwise winner
    falls back to whichever of the two has the higher mean MeanQ (even though,
    by construction, that difference is itself under `margin`) -- a real, if
    marginal, quality edge is never discarded once stability/cost are
    themselves inconclusive. The leader is replaced by the pairwise winner and
    the process repeats against the next candidate, so the final winner has
    beaten every other candidate under this rule.

    std_threshold=0.5 was checked against every candidate set this function is
    actually called on in this codebase (both ablation stages, all four

    swept in 0.05 steps -- the std criterion is exercised (both candidates
    within `margin` of each other) in some of those sets, but the outcome is
